# First some pretty obvious files that are produced by R and RStudio:
# History files
.Rhistory
.Rapp.history

# Session Data files
*.RData

# User-specific files
.Ruserdata

# RStudio (project) files
.Rproj.user/

# Then you should NOT put the cache build by your markdowns on Bitbucket:
# knitr and R markdown default cache directories
*_cache/
/cache/
# Temporary files created by R markdown
*.log
*.aux
*.out
*.utf8.md
*.knit.md

# tex files are most often created by markdown documents, so no need to push (optional)
# *.tex (however in the folder we have a .tex (template) that has to be pushed!

# R Environment Variables
.Renviron
